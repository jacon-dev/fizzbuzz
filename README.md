# FizzBuzz : The Bland Interview
FizzBuzz is one of the most common technical interview exercises I've seen during my career. 
As such I wanted to show my workings on it, including all the stages up to the existing code (i.e. what works and is quick and dirty).

Generally this probably isnt used so much anymore as there are so many resources out there now that can show you how to FizzBuzz that it makes
it a fairly redundant way to test someones programming ability.

Maybe what we should in fact ask a developer is: "How would you FizzBuzz badly?". A good developer knows what poor code looks like, so I figure
this would be a much better approach.

That aside, enjoy my brief exploration into this console app using .NET Core 3.1
